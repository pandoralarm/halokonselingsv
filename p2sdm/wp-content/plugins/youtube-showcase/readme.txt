**Get started with YouTube Showcase**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MtOJaKQZKQ

**Details**

Each YouTube video resides on its own page with WordPress comments enabled. YouTube video pages are automatically created when you insert the YouTube VIDEO ID on the video page.

YouTube Video ID is a 11 character string that YouTube uses to uniquely identify each video. For example, the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K4uBRkFJEU has the id 9K4uBRkFJEU.

Using video thumbnail quality option for videos, you can change the dimensions of thumbnails offered by YouTube. For example, you can use an image 4:3 ratio instead of default 16:9. However, you should stick to this ratio for all videos.

After you install our plugin you will see our setup assistant which creates all the required pages, ready to use.


Two YouTube Video Gallery pages are provided:

* YouTube Video Gallery
* YouTube Video Grid Gallery

**YouTube Video Gallery**

* Displays YouTube video thumbnail navigation at the bottom.
* YouTube Videos are paged after every 8th video. Page navigation is available. You can adjust the number of YouTube videos shown with a shortcode.
* For phones, thumbnail navigation is replaced with two large size PREV and NEXT icons.
* YouTube videos are ordered by the lasted video first

**YouTube Video Grid Gallery**

Displays high resolution YouTube video thumbnails in a 4 column responsive layout. YouTube Videos are paged after every 16th video.

You can build your YouTube video galleries by adding the VIDEO ID for the videos you’d like. You can add Content and Excerpt for every YouTube video. The YouTube video CONTENT text is displayed in the video page. The video EXCERPT is displayed in *YouTube Video Gallery* page, right below the main video.

All YouTube video pages are responsive and adjusts to the container so you do not need to give height or weight.

Comes with two sidebar widgets:

* Featured YouTube Videos
* Recent YouTube Videos

**Shortcode Examples**

Note: In examples, yoyoma is the slug not the label of tag or category

* Display 5 YouTube videos per page. If you have more than 5 videos, it will display a page navigation bar:

[video_grid filter="misc::posts_per_page::is::5;"]

[video_gallery filter="misc::posts_per_page::is::5;"]

* Display YouTube videos with category "yoyoma"

[video_grid filter="tax::category::is::yoyoma;"]

[video_gallery filter="tax::category::is::yoyoma;"]

* Display YouTube videos with tag "yoyoma".

[video_grid filter="tax::post_tag::is::yoyoma;"]

[video_gallery filter="tax::post_tag::is::yoyoma;"]
